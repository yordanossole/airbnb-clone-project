## Database Design

The database schema consists of the following entities and relationships:

### 1. **User**
- **Fields**:  
  `id` (UUID/PK), `email` (unique), `password_hash`, `name`, `role` (host/guest)  
- **Relationships**:  
  - One-to-Many with `Property` (A user can list multiple properties).  
  - One-to-Many with `Booking` (A user can make multiple bookings).  
  - One-to-Many with `Review` (A user can write multiple reviews).  

### 2. **Property**
- **Fields**:  
  `id` (UUID/PK), `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `location`, `host_id` (FK to User)  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Many-to-One with `User` (Each property belongs to one host).  
  - One-to-Many with `Booking` (A property can have multiple bookings).  
  - One-to-Many with `Review` (A property can receive multiple reviews).  

### 3. **Booking**
- **Fields**:  
  `id` (UUID/PK), `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`, `status` (confirmed/pending/cancelled), `guest_id` (FK to User), `property_id` (FK to Property)  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Many-to-One with `User` (A booking is made by one guest).  
  - Many-to-One with `Property` (A booking is for one property).  
  - One-to-One with `Payment` (Each booking has one payment).  

### 4. **Review**
- **Fields**:  
  `id` (UUID/PK), `rating` (1-5), `comment`, `created_at`, `author_id` (FK to User), `property_id` (FK to Property)  
- **Relationships**:  
  - Many-to-One with `User` (A review is written by one user).  
  - Many-to-One with `Property` (A review is about one property).  

### 5. **Payment**
- **Fields**:  
  `id` (UUID/PK), `amount`, `payment_method`, `status` (success/failed), `transaction_id`, `booking_id` (FK to Booking)  
- **Relationships**:  
  - One-to-One with `Booking` (A payment corresponds to one booking).

## üõ†Ô∏è Features Breakdown
1. **API Documentation**
- **OpenAPI Standard:** The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
- **Django REST Framework:** Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
- **GraphQL:** Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

2. **User Authentication**
- **Endpoints:** /users/, /users/{user_id}/
- **Features:** Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
  - Allows users to register, log in, and manage profiles (hosts/guests).  
  - Implements JWT authentication for secure access and role-based permissions (e.g., hosts can list properties).  

3. **Property Management**
- **Endpoints:** /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
- **Features:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
  - Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings with details (photos, pricing, amenities).  
  - Includes search/filter functionality (e.g., by location, price range) for guests. 

4. **Booking System**
- **Endpoints:** /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
- **Features:** Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
  - Handles reservation workflows: availability checks, date selection, and payment integration.  
  - Sends confirmation emails and updates booking status (confirmed/pending/cancelled). 

5. **Payment Processing**
- **Endpoints:** /payments/
- **Features:** Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
  - Integrates with Stripe/PayPal for secure transactions.  
  - Calculates totals (including fees) and refunds cancellations per policy.  

6. **Review System**
- **Endpoints:** /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
- **Features:** Post and manage reviews for properties.
  - Lets guests leave ratings and reviews for properties post-stay.  
  - Displays aggregate scores on property listings to build trust. 

7. **Database Optimizations**
- **Indexing:** Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- **Caching:** Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security

To protect sensitive data and ensure system integrity, the following security measures will be implemented:

### 1. **Authentication**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless user sessions.  
- **Password hashing** (bcrypt) to securely store credentials.  
- **Why?** Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and personal data (e.g., payment details, bookings).

### 2. **Authorization**
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict actions (e.g., only hosts can edit properties).  
- **Resource ownership checks** (e.g., users can only delete their own reviews).  
- **Why?** Ensures users only interact with data they‚Äôre permitted to, minimizing misuse.

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
- **Throttling** (e.g., 100 requests/minute per IP) using Django Ratelimit.  
- **Why?** Prevents brute-force attacks and API abuse (e.g., spamming bookings/reviews).

### 4. **Data Protection**
- **HTTPS/TLS** for encrypted data in transit.  
- **SQL injection prevention** via Django ORM parameterized queries.  
- **Why?** Safeguards sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, user emails).

### 5. **Payment Security**
- **PCI-DSS compliance** by using Stripe/PayPal (no direct card storage).  
- **Webhook validation** to verify payment events.  
- **Why?** Reduces fraud risk and ensures financial transactions are irreversible.

### 6. **CORS & CSRF Protection**
- **Strict CORS policies** to limit API access to trusted domains.  
- **CSRF tokens** for state-changing operations (e.g., form submissions).  
- **Why?** Blocks malicious cross-origin requests (e.g., phishing attacks).

### 7. **Monitoring & Logging**
- **Audit logs** for sensitive actions (e.g., login attempts, payment changes).  
- **Why?** Enables breach detection and forensic analysis.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. This ensures faster, more reliable software delivery.

### Why It Matters for This Project
- **Quality Control**: Automated tests catch bugs early before they reach production.  
- **Rapid Iteration**: Enables frequent, small updates instead of risky bulk releases.  
- **Consistency**: Eliminates "it works on my machine" issues via containerized environments.  

### Tools & Workflow
1. **GitHub Actions**:  
   - Runs automated tests (unit/integration) on every `git push`.  
   - Builds Docker images and deploys to staging on merge to `main`.  

2. **Docker**:  
   - Containerizes the app for identical environments (dev ‚Üí prod).  
   - Simplifies scaling and dependency management.  

3. **AWS/GCP (Optional)**:  
   - Auto-deploys to cloud servers after successful CI checks.  

4. **Monitoring (Post-Deployment)**:  
   - Tools like Sentry or New Relic track errors in production.
